# Tikal Code Challange - Rick and Morty Characters Popularity

This project involves creating a web application to interact with the Rick and Morty API to complete two specific tasks: 
1. Identifying the least popular character from Earth (C-137) based on their episode appearances. 
2. creating a bar chart to visualize the popularity of five specific characters by their episode appearances, without using any chart libraries.



## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, Vite, Styled Components, Axios, Context API


## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/shirdeck/tikal-rick-and-morty-challenge
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd rick-and-morty-app
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run dev
```


## Trade-offs and Future Improvements
### Using Libraries

- Chakra UI / Material UI: If this were a larger project and I had more time to develop and research, I would consider integrating a UI component library like Chakra UI or Material UI. These libraries provide accessible and highly customizable components, significantly speeding up development and ensuring consistent styling.
- React Query: For managing data fetching, caching, and synchronization, React Query would be a valuable addition. It would handle complex data logic, provide out-of-the-box caching mechanisms, and improve the overall performance and robustness of the application.

### Improved Responsiveness and Theming
- Improved Responsiveness: Enhanced responsiveness by using CSS Grid and Flexbox layouts, along with media queries to ensure a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.
- Theming: adding a theming system to allow for easy customization and consistent styling throughout the application. Libraries like styled-components or Emotion can be used to set up a theme provider.

### Testing
- Unit Testing: Unit tests for individual components using Jest and React Testing Library to ensure that each component behaves as expected.
## Final Thoughts

Thank you for giving me the chance to work on this project. As a Rick and Morty fan, I had a lot of fun revisiting the characters and building this application. The task was enjoyable, challenging and had room for creativeness. 

I am excited to keep learning new things and improving my skills. Working on projects like this motivates me to explore new technologies and approaches in the future, such as React Query.

Thank you again for this opportunity. Please let me know if you have any question regarding the project.
